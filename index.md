Given whether data from 150 locations during the growing season (a period of 30 weeks) over a 13 year study , we are goring to buld a model consisting
of 103,365 performance records, we are building a model to predict yearly crop yeild accurately for a specific performance record. The challenge is provided as it has a widespread of applications in plant breeding, crop science research, and agricultural production (as per the website)
