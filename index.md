# Description of the project
Given whether data from 150 locations during the growing season (a period of 30 weeks) over a 13 year study , we are goring to buld a model consisting
of 103,365 performance records, we are building a model to predict yearly crop yeild accurately for a specific performance record. The challenge is provided as it has a widespread of applications in plant breeding, crop science research, and agricultural production (as per the website[^1])

## Explaining the Model
Part of the challenge was to figure out what was going to be used in our model given the dataset. We approched it by first working on a small sample from the whole population in order to know what the desired results were before moving on to the entire dataset.
